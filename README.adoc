The Coherence-VisualVM Plugin (the Plugin) provides management and monitoring of a single Coherence cluster using the VisualVM management utility.

The Plugin aggregates Coherence MBean data and shows a concise operational view of a single Coherence cluster.
Some management information is presented over time, which allows real-time analysis and troubleshooting.
You can connect to clusters via JMX or via management over REST with Coherence versions 14.1.1 or above.

The Plugin is an ideal tool for monitoring and managing Coherence clusters during the development and testing lifecycle and supports connecting to both
Community Edition and Commercial versions of Coherence.

NOTE: This version of the Plugin requires VisualVM release 2.0.4 or later which is available from https://visualvm.github.io/.

== Supported Coherence Versions

The Plugin will connect to and display data for the following Coherence versions:

**Community Editions**: 14.1.1.0.x, 20.06.x and 20.12

**Commercial Editions**: 12.2.1.5.x,  12.2.1.4.x, 12.1.3.x, 12.1.2.x and 3.7.1.x

NOTE: If you wish to connect to Coherence version 12.2.1.4.x via REST you should have Coherence version 12.2.1.4.7 or greater.

== Installing the Plugin from VisualVM

The Coherence VisualVM Plugin is available from the list of plugins in VisualVM versions 2.0.4 and above.

To install the Plugin carry out the following:

1. Choose `Tools` -> `Plugins` from the main menu.
2. The Plugin will be displayed as `VisualVM-Coherence`. If it is not present in the list then click on the `Check for Newest` button
3. In the `Available Plugins` tab, select the Install checkbox for the `VisualVM-Coherence`. Click Install.
4. Step through and complete the plugin installer.

For more information about using the Coherence VisualVM plugin see the official https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html[Coherence Documentation].

Read on if you want to build the Plugin manually.

== Connecting to a Coherence Cluster

Once the Plugin is installed, you can double-click on a Coherence process in the left pane, usually
`com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer`, after which a `Coherence` tab will be displayed.

You can also connect via Coherence Management over REST by right-clicking on the
`Coherence Clusters` tree item and choose `Add Coherence Cluster`. See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html#GUID-9A5B5F14-26A6-49CF-8C0C-3533A5DFB9C6[Coherence Documentation]
for more information on connecting via REST.

== Connecting to Coherence in WebLogic Server

If you have Coherence running within WebLogic Server using the `Managed Coherence Servers` functionality you can either
connect via REST as described above or if you want to connect to the `domain runtime MBean server`, use the instructions below.

1. Ensure you have the same version of WebLogic Server installed locally as the instance you are connecting to.

2. Use the following (on one line) to start VisualVM replacing WLS_HOME with your WebLogic Server home.
+
[source,shell]
----
/path/to/visualvm --cp WLS_HOME/server/lib/wljmxclient.jar:WLS_HOME/server/lib/weblogic.jar
   -J-Djmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs=weblogic.management.remote
   -J-Dcoherence.plugin.visualvm.disable.mbean.check=true
----
+
NOTE: On a Mac, the default VisualVM installed is usually `/Applications/VisualVM.app/Contents/MacOS/visualvm`.
For Windows ensure that you use `visualvm.exe` and change the `/` to `\` and change the classpath separator from `:` to `;`.

3. From the VisualVM Applications tree, right-click `Local` and select `Add JMX Connection`. The Add JMX Connection dialog box displays.

4. Use either of the following connect strings depending upon the WebLogic Version you are connecting to.
+
For WebLogic Server 14.1.1.X and above use **t3** protocol:
+
[source,shell]
----
service:jmx:t3://hostname:port/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----
+
For WebLogic Server 12.2.1.5 and below use **iiop** protocol:
+
[source,shell]
----
service:jmx:iiop://hostname:port/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----
+
NOTE: in WebLogic Server 14.1.1.x and above the `wljmxclient.jar` no longer exists and will be ignored in the classpath.
You may remove it from the above `--cp` statement if you like.

5. Click `Use security credentials` and enter the WebLogic Server username and password.

6. Check `Do not require SSL connection` if your connection is not SSL and select `Connect Immediately`.

7. Right-Click on the connection and select `Open`. The Coherence tab will be displayed.


== Changing the Plugin Behaviour via System Properties

There are a number of properties that change the behaviour of the Plugin. To pass these properties
to VisvualVM you have to use the `-J` option. For example to change the refresh time from the default
of 30 seconds, you can do the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ visualvm -J-Dcoherence.plugin.visualvm.refreshtime=10
----

The following table outlines all the available properties and their use.

.Table Coherence VisualVM Properties
!===
|Property | Default | Usage
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.refreshtime| 30 |  Time (in seconds) between refreshing data from the cluster. Do not set too low as this could adversely affect performance in large clusters
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.log.query.times| false | Enables logging of query times when retrieving data
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.sorting.enabled | true | Enables JTable sorting
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.heatmap.enabled | false | Enables experimental heat map in Caches tab
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.persistence.list | true | Enables dropdown list of snapshots when performing snapshot operations
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.zoom.enabled | false | Enables additional zoom function for all graphs
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.rest.request.timeout | 30000 | The request timeout (in ms) when using REST to connect to a cluster
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.rest.request.debug | false | Enables HTTP request debugging using REST to connect to a cluster
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.disable.mbean.check | false | Disables the MBean check when connecting to WebLogic Server
!===

NOTE: If you have used older versions of the Coherence VisualVM plugin available with Coherence, you should
ensure you are using the new property names above.

== Building the Plugin

If you wish to build the Plugin from scratch you need to build the VisualVM dependencies first.
To build the plugin is a two step process:

1. Generate the VisualVM dependencies
2. Build the Coherence VisualVM Plugin

=== Pre-requisites

You must have the following:

=== Generate the VisualVM dependencies

NOTE: These instructions have been summarized from https://github.com/oracle/visualvm/blob/release204/README.md.

NOTE: A Script `install-artifacts.sh` is available in the `bin` directory to run this for a Linux/Mac environment.

1. Ensure you have JDK8 in you PATH.

push the artefacts to a remote Maven repository.

==== Build the VisualVM Plugin

1. Ensure you have JDK11 or above in your PATH.

1. Build the Plugin
+
From the `coherence-visualvm` directory:
