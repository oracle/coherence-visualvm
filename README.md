The Coherence-VisualVM Plugin (the Plugin) provides management and monitoring of a single Coherence cluster using the VisualVM management utility.

The Plugin aggregates Coherence MBean data and shows a concise operational view of a single Coherence cluster.
Some management information is presented over time, which allows real-time analysis and troubleshooting.
You can connect to clusters via JMX or via management over REST with Coherence versions 12.2.1.4 or above.

The Plugin is an ideal tool for monitoring and managing Coherence clusters during the development and testing lifecycle and supports connecting to both
Community Edition and Commercial versions of Coherence.

NOTE: The most current version of the Plugin requires VisualVM release 2.1 or later which is available from https://visualvm.github.io/.

## <a id="connect"></a> Connecting to a Coherence Cluster

### 1. Connecting Directly to a Process

Once the Plugin is installed, you can double-click on a Coherence process in the left pane, usually `com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer`, after which a `Coherence` tab will be displayed.

### 2. Connecting via Management over REST

You can also connect via Coherence Management over REST by right-clicking on the `Coherence Clusters` tree item and choose `Add Coherence Cluster`.

Provide a name for the cluster and use the following URL based upon what type of cluster you are connecting to:

1. Standalone Coherence - `http://<host>:<management-port>/management/coherence/cluster`

2. WebLogic Server -  `http://<admin-host>:<admin-port>/management/coherence/<version>/clusters` - You can use `latest` as the version.

>Note: To enable Management over REST for a stand-alone cluster, please see the
[Coherence Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/rest-reference/quick-start.html)

### 3. Connecting to Coherence in WebLogic Server via the Admin Server

If you have Coherence running within WebLogic Server using the `Managed Coherence Servers` functionality you can either
connect via REST as described above or if you want to connect to the `domain runtime MBean server`, use the instructions below.

1. Ensure you have the same version of WebLogic Server installed locally as the instance you are connecting to.

2. Use the following (on one line) to start VisualVM replacing WLS_HOME with your WebLogic Server home.

   ```bash
   /path/to/visualvm --cp WLS_HOME/server/lib/wljmxclient.jar:WLS_HOME/server/lib/weblogic.jar
      -J-Djmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs=weblogic.management.remote
      -J-Dcoherence.plugin.visualvm.disable.mbean.check=true
   ```

   >Note: On a Mac, the default VisualVM installed is usually `/Applications/VisualVM.app/Contents/MacOS/visualvm`.
   For Windows ensure that you use `visualvm.exe` and change the `/` to `\` and change the classpath separator from `:` to `;`.

3. From the VisualVM Applications tree, right-click `Local` and select `Add JMX Connection`. The Add JMX Connection dialog box displays.

4. Use either of the following connect strings depending upon the WebLogic Version you are connecting to.

   For WebLogic Server 14.1.1.X and above use **t3** protocol:

   ```bash
   service:jmx:t3://hostname:port/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
   ```
   
   For WebLogic Server 12.2.1.5 and below use **iiop** protocol:
   
   ```bash
   service:jmx:iiop://hostname:port/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
   ```

   >Note: in WebLogic Server 14.1.1.x and above the `wljmxclient.jar` no longer exists and will be ignored in the classpath.
   You may remove it from the above `--cp` statement if you like.

5. Click `Use security credentials` and enter the WebLogic Server username and password.

6. Check `Do not require SSL connection` if your connection is not SSL and select `Connect Immediately`.

7. Right-Click on the connection and select `Open`. The Coherence tab will be displayed.

   >Note: If you wish to secure access to the REST endpoints or via JMX, please refer to either the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/index.html[Coherence Documentation]
   or relevant JMX security documentation.

## <a id="prefs"></a> Changing the Plugin Behaviour via the Options Tab

In the VisualVM Plugin, you can change the behaviour of the plugin
by using the Options pane. To open the options choose the following depending upon your platform:

1. Mac:  `VisualVM` -> `Preferences` and select the `Coherence` tab.

2. Windows/Linux: `Tools` -> `Options` and select the `Coherence` tab.
